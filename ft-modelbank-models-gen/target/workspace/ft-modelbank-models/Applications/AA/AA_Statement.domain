/* The purpose of this table is to specify the dates and frequencies for producing Account statements.
Statements may be produced daily (every working day), every 1-9 weeks, twice a month (on the 15th and the last day of the month) or every 1-12 months on any day of the month.
Upto 9  statement cycles may be specified for each Account, and each statement cycle is independent.
Statements for each cycle show details of all entries since the last statement in the same cycle, regardless of the other cycle.
Within a Statement cycle, it is possible to define multiple frequencies say a combination of  Weekly and Monthly, such that Statements are produced on the dates specified by both frequencies, but only contain details of entries since the last statement in that  cycle. For example, if in Cycle 3, a frequency of Weekly (with next statement date: 6th) and Monthly (next statement date: 10th) is defined, then statement for Cycle 3 would be generated on 6th and again on 10th with entries from 7th to 10th.
If there have been no entries since the last statement, the statement may be suppressed; In such cases when there are no movements, it is possible to print the statements after a specified period defined in  AC.STMT.PARAMETER (Field: MIN.MONTHS.STMT) has elapsed. Such a  facility to suppress statement printing is available for each cycle.
For each Cycle, special interim statements, showing details of all entries since the last regular cycle  statement, may be produced without affecting the regular statement cycles. In such a case, the next regular statement in the cycle would contain the entries since the special interim statement.
If the account has a passbook then no regular statements are produced - the passbook is viewed as the statement. In this case ACCOUNT.STATEMENT simply holds details regarding the passbook balance & the next available line.
This table is also used to specify whether or not advices are to be produced when interest and charges are applied, and whether detailed interest statements (interest scale) should be produced.
Whenever a new Account is opened, an Account Statement record is automatically generated by the system. This record specifies only one Statement Cycle. Interest and charges advices, interest statements and other details are set to the values defined in AC.STMT.PARAMETER if present, otherwise they are set to 'NO'. If required, the details in this record can be changed manually.
The frequency of the first Statement Cycle generated automatically by the system depends on the Statement Group to which the Account belongs. This is determined by the rules defined in the Statement General Condition table (STMT.GEN.CONDITION). These rules are based on Customer and Account details such as Residence, Sector and Account Category. The frequency may be Daily (every working day), Weekly, or every n (1-9) Weeks, Monthly, Every n Months, Quarterly, Six Monthly or Yearly and the first date is calculated by adding the frequency to the date on which the Account is opened. For Daily statements, the first date is the date on which the Account is opened.
If the details of the Account and Customer records do not match any of the STMT.GEN.CONDITION records, the default Statement Cycle frequency is Monthly.
Internal Accounts always have a default Statement Cycle frequency of monthly.
Delivery:

Account Type
Cycle No. Application Component of
DE.PRODUCT
ID
Customer accounts
1 to 9 ACC1 to ACC9 Nostro  accounts  1 to 9 ACN1 to ACN9 Internal  accounts 1 to 9 ACI1 to ACI9
For example, for Nostro Account No. 19739, Statement Cycle No.5 and Message Type 950, a
DE.PRODUCT record could be specified with ID:  US0010001.A-19739.950.ACN5 (where US0010001 is the ID of COMPANY).

Above referred definition of DE.PRODUCT records  is not mandatory. (For detailed information on  DE.PRODUCT records, refer to the appropriate documentation for   DE.PRODUCT).

If  PRINT carrier is specified for an Account Statement Message in   DE.PRODUCT, then the Application Format component of the related Message Type's DE.FORMAT.PRINT record should be  as follows:

Account Type
Cycle No.          Application Component of DE.FORMAT.PRINT
ID

Customer accounts
1 to 9
1 to 9
Nostro  accounts
1 to 9
11 to 19
Internal  accounts
1 to 9
21 to 29

For example, for a Nostro Account,  Statement Cycle No.5 and Message Type 950 with carrier defined as PRINT in DE.PRODUCT, a DE.FORMAT.PRINT   record should exist  with an ID:  950.15.1.GB. The above referred definition of DE.FORMAT.PRINT key IDs is mandatory. (For detailed  information on DE.FORMAT.PRINT records, refer to the appropriate documentation for DE.FORMAT.PRINT).

However, in case of SWIFT (Carrier defined as SWIFT in DE.PRODUCT) messages, since only one format message is allowed per message type, the Application format would be 1, irresepctive of  type of Account and any Cycle No. For example, for SWIFT message type 940, the DE.FORMAT.SWIFT record ID would be 940.1.1, irrespective of any conditions.

It would be possible to bypass the Delivery system for specific Statement Message Type's  printed messages. For example, to bypass the Delivery system for printed Message Type  950 (with carrier specified as PRINT in  DE.PRODUCT), 950 should be defined as a  value of  p>PRINT.BYPASS in
DE.PARM. However, in this case Messages with Type 950  for which the carrier is SWIFT or TELEX would continue to be processed through the Delivery system. Notes:
(i) If Tax Advices are required, this is specified in this record, but the processing must be defined as a local requirement. At present requesting Tax Advices has no effect.
(ii) Descriptions of Account Categories and Transaction codes and details of format, address(es) and copies for account statements, interest and charges advices and interest statements are specified within the Delivery system. */

This field is automatically generated by the system when a new Account is opened to ensure that statements are produced for every Account.
It can be altered manually.
This field cannot be input if the account has a passbook.
The first part of the field specifies the next date on which the Cycle 1 statement will be produced, the 2nd part specifies the frequency for producing Cycle 1 statements.
The next date is updated automatically by the system every time a Cycle 1 statement is produced. If the next date falls on a non-working day, the statement is produced on the previous working day. The date is then updated as if the statement had been produced on the day specified, i.e. the cycle is not affected.
When amending this field manually, if the next date is omitted, the system automatically generates it as follows:
FREQUENCY NEXT DATE
B(snss) (Every business day) Next     working day after today
T(wmth) (Twice a month, 15th and     last day) The next 15th or month end from today, whichever is sooner

It is possible to enter the above     frequency options by the letter alone. The date will then default in     accordance with the frequency rules as detailed above, e.g. option 1 would     be the next working day from the system date. It is also possible to input a     frequency with a date.

If today's date is less than dd, the next date is day dd in nn months from last month, otherwise it is day dd in nn months form the current month. If this date does not exist (e.g. 30th February) the previous day is assumed (28th or 29th February).
Note - Checks are performed to ensure that the first cycle statements are requested for production not more than 12 months from the last requested date or if the account is being opened, the account opening date. Should either of these situations be encountered, it gives ride to an override situation but you may continue subject to being able to satisfy the relevant override class.

Upto 9  statement cycles may be specified for each Account, and each statement cycle is independent.
Statements for each cycle show details of all entries since the last statement in the same cycle, regardless of the other cycle.
Within a Statement cycle, it is possible to define multiple frequencies say a combination of  Weekly and Monthly, such that Statements are produced on the dates specified by both frequencies, but only contain details of entries since the last statement in that  cycle. For example, if in Cycle 3, a frequency of Weekly (with next statement date: 6th) and Monthly (next statement date: 10th) is defined, then statement for Cycle 3 would be generated on 6th and again on 10th with entries from 7th to 10th.
If there have been no entries since the last statement, the statement may be suppressed; In such cases when there are no movements, it is possible to print the statements after a specified period defined in  AC.STMT.PARAMETER (Field: MIN.MONTHS.STMT) has elapsed. Such a  facility to suppress statement printing is available for each cycle.
For each Cycle, special interim statements, showing details of all entries since the last regular cycle  statement, may be produced without affecting the regular statement cycles. In such a case, the next regular statement in the cycle would contain the entries since the special interim statement.
If the account has a passbook then no regular statements are produced - the passbook is viewed as the statement. In this case ACCOUNT.STATEMENT simply holds details regarding the passbook balance & the next available line.
This table is also used to specify whether or not advices are to be produced when interest and charges are applied, and whether detailed interest statements (interest scale) should be produced.
Whenever a new Account is opened, an Account Statement record is automatically generated by the system. This record specifies only one Statement Cycle. Interest and charges advices, interest statements and other details are set to the values defined in AC.STMT.PARAMETER if present, otherwise they are set to 'NO'. If required, the details in this record can be changed manually.
The frequency of the first Statement Cycle generated automatically by the system depends on the Statement Group to which the Account belongs. This is determined by the rules defined in the Statement General Condition table (STMT.GEN.CONDITION). These rules are based on Customer and Account details such as Residence, Sector and Account Category. The frequency may be Daily (every working day), Weekly, or every n (1-9) Weeks, Monthly, Every n Months, Quarterly, Six Monthly or Yearly and the first date is calculated by adding the frequency to the date on which the Account is opened. For Daily statements, the first date is the date on which the Account is opened.
If the details of the Account and Customer records do not match any of the STMT.GEN.CONDITION records, the default Statement Cycle frequency is Monthly.
Internal Accounts always have a default Statement Cycle frequency of monthly.
Delivery:

Account Type
Cycle No. Application Component of
DE.PRODUCT
ID
Customer accounts
1 to 9 ACC1 to ACC9 Nostro  accounts  1 to 9 ACN1 to ACN9 Internal  accounts 1 to 9 ACI1 to ACI9
For example, for Nostro Account No. 19739, Statement Cycle No.5 and Message Type 950, a
DE.PRODUCT record could be specified with ID:  US0010001.A-19739.950.ACN5 (where US0010001 is the ID of COMPANY).

Above referred definition of DE.PRODUCT records  is not mandatory. (For detailed information on  DE.PRODUCT records, refer to the appropriate documentation for   DE.PRODUCT).

If  PRINT carrier is specified for an Account Statement Message in   DE.PRODUCT, then the Application Format component of the related Message Type's DE.FORMAT.PRINT record should be  as follows:

Account Type
Cycle No.          Application Component of DE.FORMAT.PRINT
ID

Customer accounts
1 to 9
1 to 9
Nostro  accounts
1 to 9
11 to 19
Internal  accounts
1 to 9
21 to 29

For example, for a Nostro Account,  Statement Cycle No.5 and Message Type 950 with carrier defined as PRINT in DE.PRODUCT, a DE.FORMAT.PRINT   record should exist  with an ID:  950.15.1.GB. The above referred definition of DE.FORMAT.PRINT key IDs is mandatory. (For detailed  information on DE.FORMAT.PRINT records, refer to the appropriate documentation for DE.FORMAT.PRINT).

However, in case of SWIFT (Carrier defined as SWIFT in DE.PRODUCT) messages, since only one format message is allowed per message type, the Application format would be 1, irresepctive of  type of Account and any Cycle No. For example, for SWIFT message type 940, the DE.FORMAT.SWIFT record ID would be 940.1.1, irrespective of any conditions.

It would be possible to bypass the Delivery system for specific Statement Message Type's  printed messages. For example, to bypass the Delivery system for printed Message Type  950 (with carrier specified as PRINT in  DE.PRODUCT), 950 should be defined as a  value of  p>PRINT.BYPASS in
DE.PARM. However, in this case Messages with Type 950  for which the carrier is SWIFT or TELEX would continue to be processed through the Delivery system. Notes:
(i) If Tax Advices are required, this is specified in this record, but the processing must be defined as a local requirement. At present requesting Tax Advices has no effect.
(ii) Descriptions of Account Categories and Transaction codes and details of format, address(es) and copies for account statements, interest and charges advices and interest statements are specified within the Delivery system. */

This field is automatically generated by the system when a new Account is opened to ensure that statements are produced for every Account.
It can be altered manually.
This field cannot be input if the account has a passbook.
The first part of the field specifies the next date on which the Cycle 1 statement will be produced, the 2nd part specifies the frequency for producing Cycle 1 statements.
The next date is updated automatically by the system every time a Cycle 1 statement is produced. If the next date falls on a non-working day, the statement is produced on the previous working day. The date is then updated as if the statement had been produced on the day specified, i.e. the cycle is not affected.
When amending this field manually, if the next date is omitted, the system automatically generates it as follows:

T(wmth) (Twice a month, 15th and     last day) The next 15th or month end from today, whichever is sooner

If today's date is less than dd, the next date is day dd in nn months from last month, otherwise it is day dd in nn months form the current month. If this date does not exist (e.g. 30th February) the previous day is assumed (28th or 29th February).
Note - Checks are performed to ensure that the first cycle statements are requested for production not more than 12 months from the last requested date or if the account is being opened, the account opening date. Should either of these situations be encountered, it gives ride to an override situation but you may continue subject to being able to satisfy the relevant override class. However, the frequency cannot be more than 12 months.

/* The purpose of this table is to specify the dates and frequencies for producing Account statements.
Statements may be produced daily (every working day), every 1-9 weeks, twice a month (on the 15th and the last day of the month) or every 1-12 months on any day of the month.
Upto 9  statement cycles may be specified for each Account, and each statement cycle is independent.
Statements for each cycle show details of all entries since the last statement in the same cycle, regardless of the other cycle.
Within a Statement cycle, it is possible to define multiple frequencies say a combination of  Weekly and Monthly, such that Statements are produced on the dates specified by both frequencies, but only contain details of entries since the last statement in that  cycle. For example, if in Cycle 3, a frequency of Weekly (with next statement date: 6th) and Monthly (next statement date: 10th) is defined, then statement for Cycle 3 would be generated on 6th and again on 10th with entries from 7th to 10th.
If there have been no entries since the last statement, the statement may be suppressed; In such cases when there are no movements, it is possible to print the statements after a specified period defined in  AC.STMT.PARAMETER (Field: MIN.MONTHS.STMT) has elapsed. Such a  facility to suppress statement printing is available for each cycle.
For each Cycle, special interim statements, showing details of all entries since the last regular cycle  statement, may be produced without affecting the regular statement cycles. In such a case, the next regular statement in the cycle would contain the entries since the special interim statement.
If the account has a passbook then no regular statements are produced - the passbook is viewed as the statement. In this case ACCOUNT.STATEMENT simply holds details regarding the passbook balance & the next available line.
This table is also used to specify whether or not advices are to be produced when interest and charges are applied, and whether detailed interest statements (interest scale) should be produced.
Whenever a new Account is opened, an Account Statement record is automatically generated by the system. This record specifies only one Statement Cycle. Interest and charges advices, interest statements and other details are set to the values defined in AC.STMT.PARAMETER if present, otherwise they are set to 'NO'. If required, the details in this record can be changed manually.
The frequency of the first Statement Cycle generated automatically by the system depends on the Statement Group to which the Account belongs. This is determined by the rules defined in the Statement General Condition table (STMT.GEN.CONDITION). These rules are based on Customer and Account details such as Residence, Sector and Account Category. The frequency may be Daily (every working day), Weekly, or every n (1-9) Weeks, Monthly, Every n Months, Quarterly, Six Monthly or Yearly and the first date is calculated by adding the frequency to the date on which the Account is opened. For Daily statements, the first date is the date on which the Account is opened.
If the details of the Account and Customer records do not match any of the STMT.GEN.CONDITION records, the default Statement Cycle frequency is Monthly.
Internal Accounts always have a default Statement Cycle frequency of monthly.
Delivery:

Account Type
Cycle No. Application Component of
DE.PRODUCT
ID
Customer accounts
1 to 9 ACC1 to ACC9 Nostro  accounts  1 to 9 ACN1 to ACN9 Internal  accounts 1 to 9 ACI1 to ACI9
For example, for Nostro Account No. 19739, Statement Cycle No.5 and Message Type 950, a
DE.PRODUCT record could be specified with ID:  US0010001.A-19739.950.ACN5 (where US0010001 is the ID of COMPANY).

Above referred definition of DE.PRODUCT records  is not mandatory. (For detailed information on  DE.PRODUCT records, refer to the appropriate documentation for   DE.PRODUCT).

If  PRINT carrier is specified for an Account Statement Message in   DE.PRODUCT, then the Application Format component of the related Message Type's DE.FORMAT.PRINT record should be  as follows:

Account Type
Cycle No.          Application Component of DE.FORMAT.PRINT
ID

Customer accounts
1 to 9
1 to 9
Nostro  accounts
1 to 9
11 to 19
Internal  accounts
1 to 9
21 to 29

For example, for a Nostro Account,  Statement Cycle No.5 and Message Type 950 with carrier defined as PRINT in DE.PRODUCT, a DE.FORMAT.PRINT   record should exist  with an ID:  950.15.1.GB. The above referred definition of DE.FORMAT.PRINT key IDs is mandatory. (For detailed  information on DE.FORMAT.PRINT records, refer to the appropriate documentation for DE.FORMAT.PRINT).

However, in case of SWIFT (Carrier defined as SWIFT in DE.PRODUCT) messages, since only one format message is allowed per message type, the Application format would be 1, irresepctive of  type of Account and any Cycle No. For example, for SWIFT message type 940, the DE.FORMAT.SWIFT record ID would be 940.1.1, irrespective of any conditions.

It would be possible to bypass the Delivery system for specific Statement Message Type's  printed messages. For example, to bypass the Delivery system for printed Message Type  950 (with carrier specified as PRINT in  DE.PRODUCT), 950 should be defined as a  value of  p>PRINT.BYPASS in
DE.PARM. However, in this case Messages with Type 950  for which the carrier is SWIFT or TELEX would continue to be processed through the Delivery system. Notes:
(i) If Tax Advices are required, this is specified in this record, but the processing must be defined as a local requirement. At present requesting Tax Advices has no effect.
(ii) Descriptions of Account Categories and Transaction codes and details of format, address(es) and copies for account statements, interest and charges advices and interest statements are specified within the Delivery system. */

This field is automatically generated by the system when a new Account is opened to ensure that statements are produced for every Account.
It can be altered manually.
This field cannot be input if the account has a passbook.
The first part of the field specifies the next date on which the Cycle 1 statement will be produced, the 2nd part specifies the frequency for producing Cycle 1 statements.
The next date is updated automatically by the system every time a Cycle 1 statement is produced. If the next date falls on a non-working day, the statement is produced on the previous working day. The date is then updated as if the statement had been produced on the day specified, i.e. the cycle is not affected.
When amending this field manually, if the next date is omitted, the system automatically generates it as follows:

If today's date is less than dd, the next date is day dd in nn months from last month, otherwise it is day dd in nn months form the current month. If this date does not exist (e.g. 30th February) the previous day is assumed (28th or 29th February).
Note - Checks are performed to ensure that the first cycle statements are requested for production not more than 12 months from the last requested date or if the account is being opened, the account opening date. Should either of these situations be encountered, it gives ride to an override situation but you may continue subject to being able to satisfy the relevant override class. However, the frequency cannot be more than 12 months.

/* The purpose of this table is to specify the dates and frequencies for producing Account statements.
Statements may be produced daily (every working day), every 1-9 weeks, twice a month (on the 15th and the last day of the month) or every 1-12 months on any day of the month.
Upto 9  statement cycles may be specified for each Account, and each statement cycle is independent.
Statements for each cycle show details of all entries since the last statement in the same cycle, regardless of the other cycle.
Within a Statement cycle, it is possible to define multiple frequencies say a combination of  Weekly and Monthly, such that Statements are produced on the dates specified by both frequencies, but only contain details of entries since the last statement in that  cycle. For example, if in Cycle 3, a frequency of Weekly (with next statement date: 6th) and Monthly (next statement date: 10th) is defined, then statement for Cycle 3 would be generated on 6th and again on 10th with entries from 7th to 10th.
If there have been no entries since the last statement, the statement may be suppressed; In such cases when there are no movements, it is possible to print the statements after a specified period defined in  AC.STMT.PARAMETER (Field: MIN.MONTHS.STMT) has elapsed. Such a  facility to suppress statement printing is available for each cycle.
For each Cycle, special interim statements, showing details of all entries since the last regular cycle  statement, may be produced without affecting the regular statement cycles. In such a case, the next regular statement in the cycle would contain the entries since the special interim statement.
If the account has a passbook then no regular statements are produced - the passbook is viewed as the statement. In this case ACCOUNT.STATEMENT simply holds details regarding the passbook balance & the next available line.
This table is also used to specify whether or not advices are to be produced when interest and charges are applied, and whether detailed interest statements (interest scale) should be produced.
Whenever a new Account is opened, an Account Statement record is automatically generated by the system. This record specifies only one Statement Cycle. Interest and charges advices, interest statements and other details are set to the values defined in AC.STMT.PARAMETER if present, otherwise they are set to 'NO'. If required, the details in this record can be changed manually.
The frequency of the first Statement Cycle generated automatically by the system depends on the Statement Group to which the Account belongs. This is determined by the rules defined in the Statement General Condition table (STMT.GEN.CONDITION). These rules are based on Customer and Account details such as Residence, Sector and Account Category. The frequency may be Daily (every working day), Weekly, or every n (1-9) Weeks, Monthly, Every n Months, Quarterly, Six Monthly or Yearly and the first date is calculated by adding the frequency to the date on which the Account is opened. For Daily statements, the first date is the date on which the Account is opened.
If the details of the Account and Customer records do not match any of the STMT.GEN.CONDITION records, the default Statement Cycle frequency is Monthly.
Internal Accounts always have a default Statement Cycle frequency of monthly.
Delivery:

Account Type
Cycle No. Application Component of
DE.PRODUCT
ID
Customer accounts
1 to 9 ACC1 to ACC9 Nostro  accounts  1 to 9 ACN1 to ACN9 Internal  accounts 1 to 9 ACI1 to ACI9
For example, for Nostro Account No. 19739, Statement Cycle No.5 and Message Type 950, a
DE.PRODUCT record could be specified with ID:  US0010001.A-19739.950.ACN5 (where US0010001 is the ID of COMPANY).

Above referred definition of DE.PRODUCT records  is not mandatory. (For detailed information on  DE.PRODUCT records, refer to the appropriate documentation for   DE.PRODUCT).

If  PRINT carrier is specified for an Account Statement Message in   DE.PRODUCT, then the Application Format component of the related Message Type's DE.FORMAT.PRINT record should be  as follows:

Account Type
Cycle No.          Application Component of DE.FORMAT.PRINT
ID

Customer accounts
1 to 9
1 to 9
Nostro  accounts
1 to 9
11 to 19
Internal  accounts
1 to 9
21 to 29

For example, for a Nostro Account,  Statement Cycle No.5 and Message Type 950 with carrier defined as PRINT in DE.PRODUCT, a DE.FORMAT.PRINT   record should exist  with an ID:  950.15.1.GB. The above referred definition of DE.FORMAT.PRINT key IDs is mandatory. (For detailed  information on DE.FORMAT.PRINT records, refer to the appropriate documentation for DE.FORMAT.PRINT).

However, in case of SWIFT (Carrier defined as SWIFT in DE.PRODUCT) messages, since only one format message is allowed per message type, the Application format would be 1, irresepctive of  type of Account and any Cycle No. For example, for SWIFT message type 940, the DE.FORMAT.SWIFT record ID would be 940.1.1, irrespective of any conditions.

It would be possible to bypass the Delivery system for specific Statement Message Type's  printed messages. For example, to bypass the Delivery system for printed Message Type  950 (with carrier specified as PRINT in  DE.PRODUCT), 950 should be defined as a  value of  p>PRINT.BYPASS in
DE.PARM. However, in this case Messages with Type 950  for which the carrier is SWIFT or TELEX would continue to be processed through the Delivery system. Notes:
(i) If Tax Advices are required, this is specified in this record, but the processing must be defined as a local requirement. At present requesting Tax Advices has no effect.
(ii) Descriptions of Account Categories and Transaction codes and details of format, address(es) and copies for account statements, interest and charges advices and interest statements are specified within the Delivery system. */

This field is automatically generated by the system when a new Account is opened to ensure that statements are produced for every Account.
It can be altered manually.
This field cannot be input if the account has a passbook.
The first part of the field specifies the next date on which the Cycle 1 statement will be produced, the 2nd part specifies the frequency for producing Cycle 1 statements.
The next date is updated automatically by the system every time a Cycle 1 statement is produced. If the next date falls on a non-working day, the statement is produced on the previous working day. The date is then updated as if the statement had been produced on the day specified, i.e. the cycle is not affected.
When amending this field manually, if the next date is omitted, the system automatically generates it as follows:

T(wmth) (Twice a month, 15th and     last day) The next 15th or month end from today, whichever is sooner

If today's date is less than dd, the next date is day dd in nn months from last month, otherwise it is day dd in nn months form the current month. If this date does not exist (e.g. 30th February) the previous day is assumed (28th or 29th February).
Note - Checks are performed to ensure that the first cycle statements are requested for production not more than 12 months from the last requested date or if the account is being opened, the account opening date. Should either of these situations be encountered, it gives ride to an override situation but you may continue subject to being able to satisfy the relevant override class. However, the frequency cannot be more than 12 months.

/* The purpose of this table is to specify the dates and frequencies for producing Account statements.
Statements may be produced daily (every working day), every 1-9 weeks, twice a month (on the 15th and the last day of the month) or every 1-12 months on any day of the month.
Upto 9  statement cycles may be specified for each Account, and each statement cycle is independent.
Statements for each cycle show details of all entries since the last statement in the same cycle, regardless of the other cycle.
Within a Statement cycle, it is possible to define multiple frequencies say a combination of  Weekly and Monthly, such that Statements are produced on the dates specified by both frequencies, but only contain details of entries since the last statement in that  cycle. For example, if in Cycle 3, a frequency of Weekly (with next statement date: 6th) and Monthly (next statement date: 10th) is defined, then statement for Cycle 3 would be generated on 6th and again on 10th with entries from 7th to 10th.
If there have been no entries since the last statement, the statement may be suppressed; In such cases when there are no movements, it is possible to print the statements after a specified period defined in  AC.STMT.PARAMETER (Field: MIN.MONTHS.STMT) has elapsed. Such a  facility to suppress statement printing is available for each cycle.
For each Cycle, special interim statements, showing details of all entries since the last regular cycle  statement, may be produced without affecting the regular statement cycles. In such a case, the next regular statement in the cycle would contain the entries since the special interim statement.
If the account has a passbook then no regular statements are produced - the passbook is viewed as the statement. In this case ACCOUNT.STATEMENT simply holds details regarding the passbook balance & the next available line.
This table is also used to specify whether or not advices are to be produced when interest and charges are applied, and whether detailed interest statements (interest scale) should be produced.
Whenever a new Account is opened, an Account Statement record is automatically generated by the system. This record specifies only one Statement Cycle. Interest and charges advices, interest statements and other details are set to the values defined in AC.STMT.PARAMETER if present, otherwise they are set to 'NO'. If required, the details in this record can be changed manually.
The frequency of the first Statement Cycle generated automatically by the system depends on the Statement Group to which the Account belongs. This is determined by the rules defined in the Statement General Condition table (STMT.GEN.CONDITION). These rules are based on Customer and Account details such as Residence, Sector and Account Category. The frequency may be Daily (every working day), Weekly, or every n (1-9) Weeks, Monthly, Every n Months, Quarterly, Six Monthly or Yearly and the first date is calculated by adding the frequency to the date on which the Account is opened. For Daily statements, the first date is the date on which the Account is opened.
If the details of the Account and Customer records do not match any of the STMT.GEN.CONDITION records, the default Statement Cycle frequency is Monthly.
Internal Accounts always have a default Statement Cycle frequency of monthly.
Delivery:

Account Type
Cycle No. Application Component of
DE.PRODUCT
ID
Customer accounts
1 to 9 ACC1 to ACC9 Nostro  accounts  1 to 9 ACN1 to ACN9 Internal  accounts 1 to 9 ACI1 to ACI9
For example, for Nostro Account No. 19739, Statement Cycle No.5 and Message Type 950, a
DE.PRODUCT record could be specified with ID:  US0010001.A-19739.950.ACN5 (where US0010001 is the ID of COMPANY).

Above referred definition of DE.PRODUCT records  is not mandatory. (For detailed information on  DE.PRODUCT records, refer to the appropriate documentation for   DE.PRODUCT).

If  PRINT carrier is specified for an Account Statement Message in   DE.PRODUCT, then the Application Format component of the related Message Type's DE.FORMAT.PRINT record should be  as follows:

Account Type
Cycle No.          Application Component of DE.FORMAT.PRINT
ID

Customer accounts
1 to 9
1 to 9
Nostro  accounts
1 to 9
11 to 19
Internal  accounts
1 to 9
21 to 29

For example, for a Nostro Account,  Statement Cycle No.5 and Message Type 950 with carrier defined as PRINT in DE.PRODUCT, a DE.FORMAT.PRINT   record should exist  with an ID:  950.15.1.GB. The above referred definition of DE.FORMAT.PRINT key IDs is mandatory. (For detailed  information on DE.FORMAT.PRINT records, refer to the appropriate documentation for DE.FORMAT.PRINT).

However, in case of SWIFT (Carrier defined as SWIFT in DE.PRODUCT) messages, since only one format message is allowed per message type, the Application format would be 1, irresepctive of  type of Account and any Cycle No. For example, for SWIFT message type 940, the DE.FORMAT.SWIFT record ID would be 940.1.1, irrespective of any conditions.

It would be possible to bypass the Delivery system for specific Statement Message Type's  printed messages. For example, to bypass the Delivery system for printed Message Type  950 (with carrier specified as PRINT in  DE.PRODUCT), 950 should be defined as a  value of  p>PRINT.BYPASS in
DE.PARM. However, in this case Messages with Type 950  for which the carrier is SWIFT or TELEX would continue to be processed through the Delivery system. Notes:
(i) If Tax Advices are required, this is specified in this record, but the processing must be defined as a local requirement. At present requesting Tax Advices has no effect.
(ii) Descriptions of Account Categories and Transaction codes and details of format, address(es) and copies for account statements, interest and charges advices and interest statements are specified within the Delivery system. */

This field is automatically generated by the system when a new Account is opened to ensure that statements are produced for every Account.
It can be altered manually.
This field cannot be input if the account has a passbook.
The first part of the field specifies the next date on which the Cycle 1 statement will be produced, the 2nd part specifies the frequency for producing Cycle 1 statements.
The next date is updated automatically by the system every time a Cycle 1 statement is produced. If the next date falls on a non-working day, the statement is produced on the previous working day. The date is then updated as if the statement had been produced on the day specified, i.e. the cycle is not affected.
When amending this field manually, if the next date is omitted, the system automatically generates it as follows:
FREQUENCY NEXT DATE
B(snss) (Every business day) Next     working day after today
T(wmth) (Twice a month, 15th and     last day) The next 15th or month end from today, whichever is sooner

It is possible to enter the above     frequency options by the letter alone. The date will then default in     accordance with the frequency rules as detailed above, e.g. option 1 would     be the next working day from the system date. It is also possible to input a     frequency with a date.

If today's date is less than dd, the next date is day dd in nn months from last month, otherwise it is day dd in nn months form the current month. If this date does not exist (e.g. 30th February) the previous day is assumed (28th or 29th February).
Note - Checks are performed to ensure that the first cycle statements are requested for production not more than 12 months from the last requested date or if the account is being opened, the account opening date. Should either of these situations be encountered, it gives ride to an override situation but you may continue subject to being able to satisfy the relevant override class. However, the frequency cannot be more than 12 months.
